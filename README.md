# Welcome to the future. #

As sources of history and education for all ages, museums are an invaluable part of our society. However, their value may not always be recognized by those who are looking for more of a novel and fun experience than an educational one, such as young children. Our goal is to create an educational experience that blends education with entertainment in the novel, futuristic form of holograms. Using [technology first developed by students at the University of Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2P-suog684), we are developing an interactive chemistry exhibit which allows users to select from several different holographic experiences which appear to play out in real space. Although tailored to attract a younger audience, we believe that such a unique experience would be of interest to all patrons of the museum.
