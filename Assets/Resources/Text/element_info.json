"hydrogen" : "Hydrogen is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1. With a standard atomic weight of 1.008, hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table. Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all mass. Hydrogen is the primary element which makes up stars. The most common isotope of hydrogen has one proton and no neutrons.",
"helium" : "Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements. After hydrogen, helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total mass. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.",
"lithium" : "Lithium is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element. Lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and is thus stored in mineral oil. When cut, it exhibits a metallic luster, but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) compounds, such as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium.",
"beryllium" : "Beryllium is a chemical element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the collision of larger atomic nuclei with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.",
"boron" : "Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray collision and supernovae and not by normal stellar fusion, it is relatively rare element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.",
"carbon" : "Carbon is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning four electrons are available to form covalent chemical bonds. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Three isotopes occur naturally, Carbon-12 and Carbon-13 being stable, while Carbon-14 is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the oldest known elements.",
"nitrogen" : "Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. Nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen, a colorless and odorless gas with the formula N2. Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant uncombined element. Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids and DNA. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.",
"oxygen" : "Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of group 16 on the periodic table and is highly reactive, readily combining with many other chemicals and elements. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere and is the primary gas in the air that we breathe.",
"fluorine" : "Fluorine is a chemical element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale-yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative element, it is extremely reactive, as it reacts with almost all other elements, except for helium and neon.",
"neon" : "Neon is a chemical element with symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is a noble gas. Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air, causing sound which pass through it to raise in pitch. Neon is chemically inert, and no uncharged neon compounds are known.",
"sodium" : "Sodium is a chemical element with symbol Na and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell, which it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na+ cation. Sodium, along with chlorine, is one of the two ingredients in table salt.",
"magnesium" : "Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in group 2 of the periodic table, or the alkaline earth metals: all group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.",
"aluminum" : "Aluminum is a chemical element with symbol Al and atomic number 13. It is a silvery-white, soft, nonmagnetic, and ductile metal in the boron group. By mass, aluminum makes up about 8% of the Earth's crust; it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon and the most abundant metal in the crust.",
"silicon" : "Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. It is a hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic luster. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table. It is relatively unreactive. Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after oxygen.",
"phosphorous" : "Phosphorus is a chemical element with symbol P and atomic number 15. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus and red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth.",
"sulfur" : "Sulfur is a chemical element with symbol S and atomic number 16. It is abundant and nonmetallic. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow, crystalline solid at room temperature. Sulfur is most widely used in sulfuric acid and is most easily identified by its distinct aroma.",
"chlorine" : "Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive and toxic element in its pure form.",
"argon" : "Argon is a chemical element with symbol Ar and atomic number 18. It is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas. Like other noble gasses, Argon is inert. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere and the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust.",
"potassium" : "Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K and atomic number 19. Potassium is a silvery-white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife, with little force. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals, all of which have a single outer-shell valence electron that is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge, a cation, that combines with anions to form salts.",
"calcium" : "Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. As an alkaline earth metal, calcium is a fairly reactive metal. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminum. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilized remnants of early sea life."
